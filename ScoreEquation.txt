This document explains the functions that determines ranks in every level.

Each level consists in "X" rounds of a mechanic that the player has to complete to pass.

The time needed for a player to pass the mechanic, is given by T.

So, the time that is going to be evaluated to earn a rank,is given by Rank=X*T.

Notwhitstanding, the total time in each level is given by Time = InitialConstant + X*T + Sum(X_i*S_i) + X*M;

Where, 
InitialConstant is the time that the players spends reading the initial instructions.
X*T is the time required to evaluate each mechanic of each round.
S_i is the simulation time given in each X_i round. Note that S_i is not constant, depends on the time of each mechanic.
X*M is the time required to move the mouse and play. M is approximately constant.

So, to determine the Rank consider the following:

1. To Handle the InitialConstant time, rank should be counted since the player clicks the first time.
2. To handle each simulation time, every time a new enemy is generated, a variable "simulationTime" is updated adding the neccesary time to the given mechanic.
3. At the moment of calculate the time used by the player, is substracted the quantity X*M. M is fixed, and can be any value considered by the programmer.
